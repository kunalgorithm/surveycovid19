# Original and representative dataset on sentiment, behavior, and mental/financial health during COVID-19. Updated daily.

We are a group of **doctors, professors, researchers and technologists**. We started SurveyCOVID19 as a public interest project, to **create a representative and reliable dataset to help contain and fight against COVID-19**. This dataset was created with public health professionals and researchers in mind, but we encourage anyone to play around with it. The dataset is **available to download for free**.
